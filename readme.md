# Overview of the project
Investment portfolio tracker is meant to provide users with ability to track their existing investments with
minimal effort.

### Imagine a scenario: 
- You have stock investments with 2 different brokers, 
and you have some crypto investments on 3+ trading platforms for some reason.
- It would be pretty hard to go to 5+ different platforms to check how your investments are doing.
it's even harder to get consolidated analysis of your total investments.
- You would probably need to create a spreadsheet, add investments there and change current portfolio values manually every time.

### Solution
- This project should remove the need of manually setting current prices for every investment.
Prices will be fetched automatically from 3rd party APIs.
- All will be done by setting initial investment amounts via making virtual transaction.
- Every subsequent transaction will be needed only for reflecting actual deposit/withdrawal in investment platforms.

# Project structure
The project has 2 parts: 

1. **backend** 

This is an API backend built with Django REST Framework.

2. **frontend** 

This is in progress REACT frontend directory. Since I specialize in backend development,
frontend part is very primitive at the moment.



### Backend and Frontend directories contain their own readme files for setup instructions and more details.
